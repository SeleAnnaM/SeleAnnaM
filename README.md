# Hi, I’m Anna Maltseva 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m currently a student at Arizona State University, studying Graphic Information Technology (User Experience) (BS). I love building sleek, responsive web pages and learning new front-end and design techniques. After graduation, I hope to work as a UX/UI designer at a design-forward tech company.
